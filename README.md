# TypeScript and GraphQL Example

One of the strengths of GraphQL is [enforcing data types on runtime](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#sec-Value-Completion). Further, TypeScript and [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) (graphql-codegen) make it safer by typing data statically, so you can write truly type-protected code with rich IDE assists.

This template extends [Apollo Server and Client Example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/api-routes-apollo-server-and-client#readme) by rewriting in TypeScript and integrating [graphql-let](https://github.com/piglovesyou/graphql-let#readme), which runs [TypeScript React Apollo](https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/plugins/typescript-react-apollo) in [graphql-codegen](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator#readme) under the hood. It enhances the typed GraphQL use as below:

```tsx
import { useNewsQuery } from './news.graphql'

const News = () => {
	// Typed already️⚡️
	const { data: { news } } = useNewsQuery()

	return <div>{news.map(...)}</div>
}
```

By default `**/*.graphqls` is recognized as GraphQL schema and `**/*.graphql` as GraphQL documents. If you prefer the other extensions, make sure the settings of the webpack loader in `next.config.js` and `.graphql-let.yml` are consistent.

## How to use

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-typescript-graphql with-typescript-graphql-app
# or
yarn create next-app --example with-typescript-graphql with-typescript-graphql-app
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).
